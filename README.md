# 📚 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Multi-Input Model Project

## 🌟 Overview

This project focuses on developing **Multi-Input Models for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to recognize and extract text from images of documents, which may contain multiple types of input such as printed text, handwritten text, and various fonts. The multi-input approach allows the system to handle different data modalities efficiently, making it highly versatile for various OCR applications, including digitizing printed materials, scanning handwritten notes, and converting documents into machine-readable text.

The project is implemented using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, leveraging deep learning architectures like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** to process and classify the text data.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The **Multi-Input Model** for OCR includes the following components:

- **Image Input Stream**: Processed via **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to capture the spatial information from the image.
- **Sequential Input Stream**: **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, specifically **LSTMs**, process sequential data for text recognition.
- **Multi-Input Layer**: Merges the CNN and RNN outputs for final classification and recognition.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers responsible for mapping the extracted features to character outputs.

This architecture enables the model to efficiently recognize characters from both handwritten and printed text in various fonts and formats.
